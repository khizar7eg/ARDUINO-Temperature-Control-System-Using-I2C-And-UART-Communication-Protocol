# ARDUINO-Temperature-Control-System-Using-I2C-And-UART-Communication-Protocol
Simulation of Arduino based Temperature Control System installed in a Data center building comprises of two floors, on Proteus software.

<strong>Instruction:</strong>
Add the respective .hex file links to the Slave-1, Slave-2 and Master Arduino in Proteus before simulation.

The Project is designed in response to the following given problem:

<ui>
A Data Center hire services of an Engineering firm to install temperature control system at its facility. Data center building comprises of two floors.
Following are the requirement of data center:<br></br>
<li> Temperature to be maintain on first and second floor is to be set using user input from control room, where master Arduino is located. When entering temperature LCD should display it.
<li> Using the I2C communication protocol required temperature to be transferred to slave Arduino’s on first and second floor of building. Slave Arduinos controls air-conditioning system of their respective floor. If required temperature is less than measured room temperature, then AC will turn on (i.e. motor turns on). Temperature sensor are installed at each floor that measures room temperature.
<li> Using serial UART communication, display the following data on serial monitor (virtual terminal) on each floor.
</ui>
<br></br>
Room Temperature: 26 ֯C <br>
Set Temperature : 25 ֯C <br>
Air conditioning : ON

Simulate the above task in PROTEUS.
